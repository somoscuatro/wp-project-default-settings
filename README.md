# WordPress Project Default Settings

This repository serves as a centralized collection of configurations and
standards that we apply across all our WordPress-based projects to ensure
consistency, quality, and efficiency.

These settings are an integral part of our development workflow and are
automatically applied when initializing a new project using [our custom
`wp-project-scaffold`
script](https://github.com/somoscuatro/homebrew-wp-project-scaffold) available
through Homebrew.

## What's Included

This repository includes a variety of configuration files and settings, such as:

- Editor configuration for consistent coding styles
- Linting and formatting rules for clean and maintainable code
- Pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before commits
- GitHub Actions workflows for continuous integration and deployment
- And more...

By using these settings, you can quickly bootstrap a WordPress project that
adheres to our best practices and coding standards.
